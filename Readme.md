## Installation:
1. If you are starting in a virtual environment, then you can make a conda environment or with 'pip install virtualenv' and then install the prerequisite libraries with: 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
2. For other 2 main libraries (DETIC & MiDaS) installation, please look into the Assignment_Notebook.ipynb where the procedure is explained.

## Usage:
1. The easiest way to get the results from any image is just run the notebook from top to bottom. I will suggest to run this google colab as it was mainly run on that.
2. The other things are explained in the notebook itself.
3. There is this one main image generating function 'imageDelayering' to generate the 3 images simultaneously with the algorithms specified.
